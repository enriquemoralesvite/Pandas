## Interpolation and Extrapolation with NumPy and Matplotlib
This Python project demonstrates how to estimate values using interpolation and extrapolation techniques with NumPy and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

# 🚀 Description
Interpolation: Estimating values within a range of known data points.
Extrapolation: Predicting values beyond the known range using a linear approximation.
The program provides a graphical representation of the known data points, interpolated value, and extrapolated value for better clarity.
## 📦 Technologies Used
# Python
NumPy: Numerical computation.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
# ⚙️ How It Works
Define known data points (days and heights).
Estimate an intermediate value using linear interpolation.
Predict a value beyond the dataset using linear extrapolation.
Plot the results, showing known data points, interpolated, and extrapolated values.
#📊 Graphical Output Example
Blue dots: Known data points
Green dot: Interpolated point
Red dot: Extrapolated point
